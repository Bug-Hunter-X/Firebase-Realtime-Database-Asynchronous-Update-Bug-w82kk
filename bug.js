In a Firebase project, data might not be updated correctly in Realtime Database if you don't handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations.  For example, if you try to update a value and immediately read it back, the read might occur before the write completes, resulting in stale data. This often happens when using `set()` or `update()` methods without proper error handling or asynchronous callbacks.

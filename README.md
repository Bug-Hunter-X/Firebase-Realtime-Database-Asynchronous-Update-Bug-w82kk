# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Update Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase Realtime Database: data not updating correctly due to the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

When updating data in the Realtime Database, the update operation is asynchronous. If you attempt to read the data immediately after writing it, you might retrieve the old value before the write completes. This is because the read operation executes before the write operation finishes.

## Solution

The solution involves using promises or async/await to ensure the write operation completes before reading the updated data.  This ensures data consistency and prevents unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates this approach.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project (see Firebase documentation).
4. Run `bug.js` to see the problematic behavior.
5. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
